# AdminCall
Walking Simulator / Exploration Game


ADMIN CALL is an exploration game where the player must explore a malfunctioning space station, collect data keys and read data logs. There is only one level and it lasts between 3-5 minutes, depending on how fast the player is to collect all data keys.
All of the controls are optimised for a desktop computer or laptop. Most in-game actions are controlled using the keyboard while some minor actions are performed using the mouse.
Victory is achieved once all data keys are collected and the player is returned to the main menu.

CONTROLS
⦁	The following controls are used to control the player character.
⦁	Using the WASD keys, the player can move The Admin around the station.
⦁	By moving the mouse, the player can look around .
⦁	During context sensitive actions such as looking at a key, the player can press the ‘E’ key to pick up and collect the object. These context sensitive actions are indicated with a hand icon in the players HUD.
⦁	By right clicking, the player can zoom in slightly. This has no practical use outside of aesthetic purposes to help immerse the player.
⦁	By left clicking, the player can interact with the game menu.

GAME STORY SUMMARY
Maintenance is due on Kazama station. A unique bug has infested the hive network on the station resulting in all of the bots to eternally loop their final 3 seconds of activity. While the station may be lost, the data they have collected may be of some value. It’s up to you to collect this data and ONLY this data. Any interaction with the bots and their data logs are to be avoided at all costs.

Repository contains a brief 10 pager Game Design Doc and both a Windows and Mac build for the game.

Done as a Project for Introduction to 3D Game Development module as part of the Entertainment Systems course in WIT.
